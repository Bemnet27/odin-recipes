    <h1>Chili Dog Mac and Cheese</h1>
    <img src="./mac and cheese.jpg" alt="Chili Dog mac and Cheese">

    <div id="flow">
    <p>
        This chili dog mac and cheese combines two of my favorite things to eat—chili dogs and mac and cheese—and manages not to taste all that much like either one, while being wildly successful at being stupendously delicious.
    </p>
    </div>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 large onion, diced</li>
        <li>2 generous teaspoons kosher salt, plus more to taste</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons chili powder</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano, preferably Mexican oregano</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 cup diced green peppers</li>
        <li>1 pound hot dogs, sliced</li>
        <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes (or 3 1/2 cups tomato sauce or puree)</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups water</li>
        <li>2 rounded cups elbow macaroni</li>
        <li>8 ounces shredded white Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>8 ounces shredded Monterey Jack cheese</li>
        <li>green onions, sliced, for the top (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add olive oil to a large pot and place over high heat. Add beef; cook and stir, breaking up with a spoon or spatula, about 2 minutes. Add onions and salt, and cook, stirring, until beef is crumbly, and onions turn translucent, about 5 minutes</li>
        <li>Add the chili powder, cumin, paprika, black pepper, cinnamon, cayenne, dried oregano, and garlic. Cook, stirring, for about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add peppers, sliced hot dogs, crushed tomatoes, and water. Stir together; bring the mixture to a simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until cooked to your taste, at least 30 minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning.</li>
        <li>Once chili is nearly ready, fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in macaroni and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, 1 minute less than specified in package directions, until not quite tender, and still firm to the bite, about 8 to 11 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Turn off heat under chili, drain macaroni, and add to the pot of chili. Stir until combined, and transfer mixture into a large, deep (15x10-inch) baking dish.</li>
        <li>Mix Cheddar and Monterey Jack cheeses together in a bowl, and transfer about 60% of cheese to top of chili mixture. Use a spoon to thoroughly mix cheese into the casserole.</li>
        <li>Apply remaining cheese evenly over the top, and lightly poke down into the surface with the tip of a spoon.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly, 30 to 35 minutes. Let rest 15 minutes before serving, topped with green onions.</li>

        Creamy, flavorful and so easy to fix. This meal-in-one will wow family and friends. Makes a lot, so freeze some or halve the recipe.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup seasoned bread crumbs</li>
        <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) box penne pasta</li>
        <li>6 cups cubed cooked chicken</li>
        <li>4 cups shredded Italian cheese blend</li>
        <li>3 cups fresh baby spinach</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) jar Alfredo sauce</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) jar pesto sauce</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. Combine the bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, and olive oil in a small bowl until evenly moistened; set aside.</li>
        <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the penne, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, combine the chicken in a bowl with the Italian cheese blend, spinach, tomatoes, alfredo sauce, pesto sauce, and milk. Stir in the pasta once done, and scoop into the prepared baking dish. Top with the bread crumb mixture.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly and golden brown on top, 40 to 45 minutes.</li>
